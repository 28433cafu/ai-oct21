question 1.1:
bookPrice = 24.95
discount = 40/100
totalNumberOfBooks= 60

wholeSalePrice = bookPrice*discount
shippingFirstCopy = 3
shippingSubsequentCopies = 0.75

totalBookCost = wholeSalePrice*totalNumberOfBooks
totalShippingCost = shippingFirstCopy + (shippingSubsequentCopies*59)

totalWholeSaleCost = totalBookCost + totalShippingCost

#i will now create a function for calculating the total wholesale cost
def wholeSaleCost(totalWholeSaleCost):
    return totalWholeSaleCost

print(totalWholeSaleCost)


bookPrice = 24.95
discount = 40/100
totalNumberOfBooks= 60
NumberOfSubsequentCopies = 59
shippingFirstCopy = 3
shippingSubsequentCopies = 0.75

wholeSalePrice = bookPrice*discount
totalBookCost = wholeSalePrice*totalNumberOfBooks
totalShippingCost = shippingFirstCopy + (shippingSubsequentCopies*NumberOfSubsequentCopies)

#i will now create a function for calculating the total wholesale cost
def wholeSaleCost(totalBookCost, totalShippingCost):
    totalWholeSaleCost = totalBookCost + totalShippingCost
    return totalWholeSaleCost

print(totalWholeSaleCost)


question 1.2:
classAge = 28
numberInClass = 0

def myClassAge (classAge, numberInClass):
    averageAge = classAge/numberInClass
    return averageAge

print(averageAge)
